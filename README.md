### Hello there!

I'm Lakshitha, an engineering student based in India.

I am figuring my way out in the tech world one step at a time
I learn as I build - and break stuff occasionally (okay... maybe a little bit more than occasionally)

When I'm not panicking over deadlines, I hit the gym (home gym for now), make crafts and write poetry during my free time.
